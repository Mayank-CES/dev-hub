# Heaps

## Definitions
A heap is a complete binary tree.
the binary tree is a tree in which the node can have utmost two children.
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels except the last level, i.e., leaf node should be completely filled, and all the nodes should be left-justified.

Heaps are used in graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm and Prim’s algorithm for finding the shortest paths and minimum spanning trees.


## Types
1. **Min Heap**: The value of the parent node should be less than or equal to either of its children.
2. **Max Heap**: The value of the parent node is greater than or equal to its children.

Heap can also be thought of as an array -

## Applications: 
1. Priority Queues
2. Selection Algorithms
3. Graph Algorithms

### Priority Queues

Normal Queues   -> First in First Out
Priority Queues -> Highest Priority Served First
