# Builder Pattern
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
Unlike other creational patterns, Builder doesn’t require products to have a common interface. That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process.


## Problem
Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step initialization of many fields and nested objects. Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters. Or even worse: scattered all over the client code.


## Solution
The Builder pattern suggests that you extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separate objects called builders.

### Director
You can go further and extract a series of calls to the builder steps you use to construct a product into a separate class called director. The director class defines the order in which to execute the building steps, while the builder provides the implementation for those steps.


## Example 

The Builder pattern is used when the desired product is complex and requires multiple steps to complete. In this case, several construction methods would be simpler than a single monstrous constructor. The potential problem with the multistage building process is that a partially built and unstable product may be exposed to the client. The Builder pattern keeps the product private until it’s fully built.

In the below code, we see different types of houses (igloo and normalHouse) being constructed by iglooBuilder and normalBuilder. Each house type has the same construction steps. The optional director struct helps to organize the building process.

###  iBuilder.go: Builder interface
```
package main

type IBuilder interface {
    setWindowType()
    setDoorType()
    setNumFloor()
    getHouse() House
}

func getBuilder(builderType string) IBuilder {
    if builderType == "normal" {
        return newNormalBuilder()
    }

    if builderType == "igloo" {
        return newIglooBuilder()
    }
    return nil
}
```

### normalBuilder.go: Concrete builder

```
package main

type NormalBuilder struct {
    windowType string
    doorType   string
    floor      int
}

func newNormalBuilder() *NormalBuilder {
    return &NormalBuilder{}
}

func (b *NormalBuilder) setWindowType() {
    b.windowType = "Wooden Window"
}

func (b *NormalBuilder) setDoorType() {
    b.doorType = "Wooden Door"
}

func (b *NormalBuilder) setNumFloor() {
    b.floor = 2
}

func (b *NormalBuilder) getHouse() House {
    return House{
        doorType:   b.doorType,
        windowType: b.windowType,
        floor:      b.floor,
    }
}
```

### iglooBuilder.go: Concrete builder

```
package main

type IglooBuilder struct {
    windowType string
    doorType   string
    floor      int
}

func newIglooBuilder() *IglooBuilder {
    return &IglooBuilder{}
}

func (b *IglooBuilder) setWindowType() {
    b.windowType = "Snow Window"
}

func (b *IglooBuilder) setDoorType() {
    b.doorType = "Snow Door"
}

func (b *IglooBuilder) setNumFloor() {
    b.floor = 1
}

func (b *IglooBuilder) getHouse() House {
    return House{
        doorType:   b.doorType,
        windowType: b.windowType,
        floor:      b.floor,
    }
}
```

### house.go: Product
```
package main

type House struct {
    windowType string
    doorType   string
    floor      int
}
```

### director.go: Director
```
package main

type Director struct {
    builder IBuilder
}

func newDirector(b IBuilder) *Director {
    return &Director{
        builder: b,
    }
}

func (d *Director) setBuilder(b IBuilder) {
    d.builder = b
}

func (d *Director) buildHouse() House {
    d.builder.setDoorType()
    d.builder.setWindowType()
    d.builder.setNumFloor()
    return d.builder.getHouse()
}
```

### main.go: Client code
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    normalBuilder := getBuilder("normal")
    iglooBuilder := getBuilder("igloo")

    director := newDirector(normalBuilder)
    normalHouse := director.buildHouse()

    fmt.Printf("Normal House Door Type: %s\n", normalHouse.doorType)
    fmt.Printf("Normal House Window Type: %s\n", normalHouse.windowType)
    fmt.Printf("Normal House Num Floor: %d\n", normalHouse.floor)

    director.setBuilder(iglooBuilder)
    iglooHouse := director.buildHouse()

    fmt.Printf("\nIgloo House Door Type: %s\n", iglooHouse.doorType)
    fmt.Printf("Igloo House Window Type: %s\n", iglooHouse.windowType)
    fmt.Printf("Igloo House Num Floor: %d\n", iglooHouse.floor)
}
```

### output.txt: Execution result
```
Normal House Door Type: Wooden Door
Normal House Window Type: Wooden Window
Normal House Num Floor: 2

Igloo House Door Type: Snow Door
Igloo House Window Type: Snow Window
Igloo House Num Floor: 1
```
