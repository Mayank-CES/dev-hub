# System Architecture:

## Definition:

System Architecture refers to the high-level structure of a software system, encompassing its components and their interactions. It provides a blueprint for the system and a roadmap for development and maintenance, guiding the arrangement and interactions of the various elements to ensure they work together to fulfill the system's requirements and objectives.

## Components:

### Subsystems or Services:
These are the distinct units within the system that collectively provide the system's functionality. Each component usually encapsulates a specific piece of the systemâ€™s functionality and operates relatively independently.
#### Examples:
 - Database Service: Manages data storage, retrieval, and integrity.
 - Authentication Service: Handles user authentication and authorization.
 - User Interface Module: Manages user interaction and presentation logic.
 - Payment Gateway: Processes payment transactions.
#### Properties:
 - Encapsulation: Each component hides its internal details and exposes a public interface.
 - Reusability: Components can be reused across different parts of the system or in different projects.
 - Independent Deployment: Components can be developed, deployed, and updated independently.

### Architectural Styles:

#### Monolithic Architecture:

**Definition:** A single-tiered software application where all components are combined into a single program.
**Characteristics:**
 - Easy to develop and deploy initially.
 - Tightly coupled components.
 - Difficult to scale and maintain as the application grows.
**Use Cases:** Small to medium-sized applications with straightforward requirements.

#### Microservices Architecture:

**Definition:** An approach where the application is composed of small, loosely coupled services that communicate over a network.
**Characteristics:**
 - Highly scalable and maintainable.
 - Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
 - Requires complex infrastructure management.
**Use Cases:** Large, complex applications requiring high scalability and agility.

#### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):

**Definition:** A design pattern where services are provided to other components by application components, through a network.
**Characteristics:**
 - Services are coarse-grained and designed to be reusable.
 - Communication typically through protocols like SOAP.
 - Focus on enterprise-level integration.
**Use Cases:** Enterprise applications with multiple, interoperable services.

#### Event-Driven Architecture:

**Definition:** A software architecture pattern promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events.
**Characteristics:**
 - Decouples event producers from event consumers.
 - Promotes responsiveness and scalability.
 - Complexity in managing event flows and ensuring event consistency.
**Use Cases:** Applications requiring real-time processing, such as IoT systems, real-time analytics.

### Design Considerations:

#### Layering:

**Definition:** Dividing the system into layers, each with a specific responsibility, such as presentation, business logic, and data access.
**Benefits:**
Simplifies development and maintenance.
Promotes separation of concerns.
**Challenges:** Ensuring efficient communication between layers without creating tight coupling.

#### Modularity:

**Definition:** The degree to which a system's components can be separated and recombined.
**Benefits:**
Enhances maintainability and reusability.
Facilitates parallel development.
**Challenges:** Defining clear module boundaries and managing dependencies.

#### Component Interactions:

**Definition:** The ways in which different components of the system communicate and collaborate to provide functionality.
**Types:**
 - **Synchronous Communication:** Immediate response required, e.g., HTTP requests.
 - **Asynchronous Communication:** No immediate response required, e.g., message queues.
**Considerations:**
 - Choosing the right communication protocol.
 - Ensuring data consistency and reliability.

#### Technology Stacks:

**Definition:** The combination of technologies used to build and run an application.
**Components:**
 - **Frontend Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular.
 - **Backend Technologies:** Server-side languages like Java, Python, Node.js.
 - **Database Technologies:** SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra.
 - **Infrastructure Technologies:** Cloud services like AWS, Azure, GCP; containerization tools like Docker, Kubernetes.

**Considerations:**
 - Compatibility and integration between different technologies.
 - Scalability and performance requirements.
 - Team expertise and support availability.
