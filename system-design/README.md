# System Design

Welcome to the System Design Section. This space is dedicated to the exploration of various system design scenarios, each offering valuable insights into the challenges and solutions involved in creating robust software systems.

## System Design Basics

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. Effective system design ensures scalability, performance, reliability, and maintainability of software applications.

## System Design Scenarios

Here's a list of the system design scenarios included in this repository, along with a basic summary of each:

1. **Scenario 1**
   - **Challenges**: [Briefly describe the challenges.]
   - **Key Learnings**: [Summarize the key takeaways.]

2. **Scenario 2**
   - **Challenges**: [Briefly describe the challenges.]
   - **Key Learnings**: [Summarize the key takeaways.]

3. **Scenario 3**
   - **Challenges**: [Briefly describe the challenges.]
   - **Key Learnings**: [Summarize the key takeaways.]
